# Hugging Face Pipelines

Hugging Face provides a comprehensive set of pipelines that leverage pre-trained models to perform various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. These pipelines offer an easy-to-use interface for tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, and token classification.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the `transformers` library provided by Hugging Face. You can do this via pip:


## Usage

### Available Pipelines

Hugging Face offers the following pipelines:

- Text Classification
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Question Answering
- Summarization
- Translation
- Text Generation
- Token Classification

Each pipeline is designed to handle specific NLP tasks, and they come with pre-trained models that can be used out-of-the-box.

### Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the text classification pipeline:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the text classification pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment of a text
result = classifier("I love using Hugging Face pipelines!")
print(result)
